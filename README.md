My project runs using screen. To start:
SSH into the VPS
Run cd ~/project/app && npm run build
Run cd ~/project/server && screen -S finalproject
Inside screen, run: npm run start:app
Detach from screen with Ctrl+A D.


All components of my website are dynamic, that being said, the journal commponenet is not dynamic in relation to the user compared to the other components that will switch the data based on the userid/credentials
